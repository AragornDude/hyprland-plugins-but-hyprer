# hyprland-plugins-but-hyprer

This repo houses upgraded versions of the official plugins for Hyprland ([hyprland-plugins](https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprland-plugins)).

This repo is currently just me adding some functionality to the hyprbars plugin, and as such only contains that plugin, not all of the hyprland plugins, though I imagine I may add more upgraded versions of the original plugins.
